# volunteer_scout_mobile_app

Volunteer Scout is intended to open doors for people, no matter what age, who love volunteering, but have difficulties finding the right events and right people who will help them. It is a way of helping people engage in such volunteering actions more often, by creating a network between individuals with the same passion. Also, Volunteer Scout is a place where people can maintain and nurse their existing (offline) friendships and create new (online) friendships.
